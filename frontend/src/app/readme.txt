this turned out to be quite scuffed. 
couldnt make it work due to some weird error. 
it would get the things status code 200 then not display them
it didnt state there was an error it just didnt display it
even imported the one from your videos which ive had working before, same thing
tried one of my classmates frontends, same thing
tried to wing it and start from scratch and now it doesnt work
no more time
